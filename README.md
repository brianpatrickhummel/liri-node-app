## LIRI NODE App

### This *Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface* is a Node.js CLI application that allows a user to query the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB API's.

* The application runs in the Node.js command line interface.
* The application interacts with the user through the *Inquirer.js* NPM Library.
* Asynchronous calls are made to the Twitter API using the *twitter* NPM Library.
* Asynchronous calls are made to the Spotify API using the *node-spotify-api* NPM Library.
* HTTP calls are made to the OMDB API by using the *Request* NPM Library.
* Each user interaction is time-stamped and committed to a Log file via the Node FS Module.
